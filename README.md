# The iOS application iCapucine is a project about flowers in a flower garden. 
# The application shows a list of flowers, including a flower name, rating, and photo. User can add, remove, or edit a flower. To add a new flower or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular flower. Flower photos can be selected from the photo library.
# Data persistence is implemented using NSCoding protocol that enables a lightweight solution for archiving objects and other structures. Archived objects can be stored on disk and retrieved across multiple runs. Whenever the app launches, it loads the existing data. When the data is modified, the app saves it. The app can terminate safely without losing any data.
